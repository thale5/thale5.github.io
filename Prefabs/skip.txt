# PREFAB SKIPPING USING LOADING SCREEN MOD
#

# Comment lines start with hashtag.


Buildings:


# The above heading means that what follows concerns building prefabs.
# But Buildings are the default, so the heading is not mandatory here.

# When you skip a building, it will not be available in game.
# To skip some buildings, just name them, one building per line, like here.
Ore 4x3 Processing
Ore 4x3 Processing02
Space Elevator

# All building names are available here, with pictures:
# https://thale5.github.io/Prefabs/

# You can use wildcards. * means any number of characters while ? means one character.
# In case you are wondering, yes, you can just type * to skip all buildings.

# This line skips all buildings that contain the word 'processing' in the name.
*processing*

# Skipping ignores case, so these two lines mean the same.
*Processing*
*processing*

#
# SERVICES AND SUB-SERVICES
#

# To limit skipping to some service, you can add a service prefix.
# This skips all industrial buildings that contain the word processing.
Industrial:*processing*

# To be even more specific, you can use a sub-service prefix instead.
# This skips all industrial ore buildings that contain the word processing.
# Generic, oil, farming and forestry industry are not affected by this.
IndustrialOre:*processing*

# You find the service and sub-service prefixes by following the link above.
# Look for the second line in the grey boxes.

#
# ADDING EXCEPTIONS
#

# Let's say there is one industrial ore processing building I would like to use,
# regardless of skipping. I can do that by adding an exception for it.
Except:Ore 2x2 Processing

# Any exceptions you add outweigh skipping.

# Here is another example about exceptions.
# Skip all commercial buildings except the new commercial eco ones.
Commercial:*
Except:CommercialEco:*

# One more example.
# Skip all shops but keep the shopping center and all industrial sweatshops.
*shop*
Except:shopping_center
Except:Industrial:*sweatshop*

#
# ADVANCED FEATURES
#

# If you are familiar with C# regular expressions, you can use them.
# Just use @ to mark the pattern as a regex.
# These two lines mean the same.
IndustrialOre:*processing*
IndustrialOre:@^.*processing.*$

#
# THINGS TO REMEMBER
#

# You can use spaces and/or lowercase in the prefixes if you like, for better readability.
# These two lines mean the same.
IndustrialOre:*processing*
industrial ore : *processing*

# Some things that Cities Skylines considers as buildings do not look like buildings.
# Those things include pillars, pipes, and network connections.
# You should keep that in mind if you use a powerful pattern such as * to skip everything.
# I recommend adding the exceptions shown below if you use the * pattern or something similar.

# VEHICLE SKIPPING
#


Vehicles:


# The above heading means that what follows concerns vehicle prefabs.
# You can skip vehicles just like you skip buildings. You can skip them by name,
# use wildcards and prefixes, and add exceptions.

# I do not want to see these ones in game.
Donut Van
Bugspray Van

# Not a fan of these, either.

# I would like to skip Tractor and its trailers because they look silly on highways.
# However, Tractor is the only Industrial Farming vehicle in the base game. Farms cannot
# operate without vehicles!
# To skip these ones, I need to find replacements on the workshop first.
# Industries DLC has a new Industrial Farming truck. If you have the DLC, you are covered.
#Tractor
#Tractor Trailer
#Tractor Trailer 02

# You should not skip Sedan because it is special in the game (used as a fallback vehicle).
# To prevent accidental skipping, you can add an exception for it like shown here.
Except:Sedan

# I have tested skipping all vehicle prefabs and the game worked. However, as mentioned above,
# city services do not function properly without vehicles. Also remember that metros, bicycles
# airplanes, ships, etc. are also vehicles.

#
# PROP SKIPPING
#


Props:


# The above heading means that what follows concerns prop prefabs. Again, you can skip by name,
# use wildcards and prefixes, and add exceptions.

# The game has too many flashy billboards. Let's skip them, starting with the awful ones.

# Because the game uses prop variations (explained on the Props htm page),
# the more billboards you skip, the more often you see the remaining variations,
# which becomes annoying. Skipping most of the big billboards works best for me.

# UNITY LEVEL SKIPPING
#


Levels:


# The above heading means that what follows concerns Unity level loading. Here, you
# can skip only by Unity level name.

# Level skipping is actually the most efficient form of skipping because the level
# is skipped as a whole. However, you must be careful because some levels contain
# buildings and events. If you have used some level content in your savegame, do
# not skip that level!
