# BASIC SKIPPING
#

# Comment lines start with hashtag.

# When you skip a building, it will not be available in game.
# To skip some buildings, just name them, one building per line:
Ore 4x3 Processing
Ore 4x3 Processing02
Space Elevator

# All building names are available here, with pictures:
# https://cdn.rawgit.com/thale5/Buildings/2018/index.htm

# You can use wildcards: * means any number of characters while ? means one character.
# In case you are wondering: yes, you can just type * to skip all buildings.
# This line skips all buildings that contain the word processing in the name:
*processing*

# Skipping ignores case, so these two mean the same:
*Processing*
*processing*

#
# SERVICES AND SUB-SERVICES
#

# To limit skipping to some service, you can add a service prefix.
# This skips all industrial buildings that contain the word processing:
Industrial:*processing*

# To be even more specific, you can use a sub-service prefix instead.
# This skips all industrial ore buildings that contain the word processing.
# Generic, oil, farming and forestry industry are not affected by this:
IndustrialOre:*processing*

# You find the service and sub-service prefixes on the page linked above.
# Look for the second line in the grey boxes.

#
# ADDING EXCEPTIONS
#

# Let's say there is one industrial ore processing building I would like to use,
# regardless of skipping. I can do that by adding an exception for it:
Except:Ore 2x2 Processing

# Any exceptions you add outweigh skipping.

# Here is another example about exceptions.
# Skip all commercial buildings except the new commercial eco ones:
Commercial:*
Except:CommercialEco:*

# One more example.
# Skip all shops but keep the shopping center and all industrial sweatshops:
*shop*
Except:shopping_center
Except:Industrial:*sweatshop*

#
# ADVANCED FEATURES
#

# If you are familiar with C# regular expressions, you can use them.
# Just use @ to mark the pattern as a regex.
# These two lines mean the same:
IndustrialOre:*processing*
IndustrialOre:@^.*processing.*$

#
# LASTLY
#

# You can use spaces and/or lowercase in the prefixes if you like, for better readability.
# These two lines mean the same:
IndustrialOre:*processing*
industrial ore : *processing*

# Some things that Cities Skylines considers as buildings do not look like buildings.
# Those things include pillars, pipes, and network connections.
# You should keep that in mind if you use a powerful pattern such as * to skip all buildings.
# I recommend adding the exceptions shown below if you use the * pattern or something similar.
# However, the game runs even if you don't add these exceptions.
